# HealthBuddy

Healthbuddy is a demo app that illustrates UI design and functionality in a health-based application.
This app includes information on exercises as well as nutrition and diet plans.
This was made possible by third-party libraries and hours of work and is still an experimental project.

Functionalities include:
  - Progress bars, bar charts, and pie charts with animations and colors
  - GIF implementation
  - Settings that give user freedom to control the app

Functionalities needed to be added:
  - Customize profile/account
  - Adding food
  - Controlling the date
  - Favoriting an exercise/food
  - Updating weather
  - Make goals/achievements workable
